## Customization

### Set major mode for editing buffer

The default major mode of editing buffer is `text-mode`. You can change the major mode manually. If you want to use a different major mode as the default, set `atomic-chrome-default-major-mode` like below.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq atomic-chrome-default-major-mode 'markdown-mode)
```

Additionally, you can use `atomic-chrome-url-major-mode-alist` to choose the major mode for a specific website based on the page URL like below.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq atomic-chrome-url-major-mode-alist
      '(("github\\.com" . gfm-mode)
        ("redmine" . textile-mode)))
```

This is an association list of regexp and major mode function. If the page URL matches to on of the regexp, the corresponding major mode is selected.

### Select editing buffer style

You can select the style of opening the editing buffer by `atomic-chrome-buffer-open-style` like below.

``` emacs-lisp
(setq atomic-chrome-buffer-open-style 'frame)
```

Available values are the followings.

* `full`: Open in the selected window.
* `split`: Open in the new window by splitting the selected window (default).
* `frame`: Create a new frame and window in it.

`frame` is available only when you are using Emacs on some window system.

If you select `frame`, you can also set the width and height of the frame with `atomic-chrome-buffer-frame-width` and `atomic-chrome-buffer-frame-height`. Their default values are `80` and `25`.
